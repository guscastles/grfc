# The Georges River Football Club Match Statistics App

My son is playing for the GRFC U8 soccer team and I am their manager.
I have created a Python application for them to know how their 
performance is based on the statitiscs for each game.

## Spreadsheets, Google Sheets, and Data Analysis

This little project delve into the wonderful world of Data Analysis,
albeit simple, it gives opportunity to explore the Python Data Analyis
Library (Pandas), fetching data from a Google Sheets spreadsheet and,
why not, functional programming style in Python.

## Testing

The test file 'GRFC U8.xlsx' is under folder *misc*. The names are not the real
names of the players, for obvious reasons, but the data is the real one
collected throughout the season.

The file must be placed in a folder under the user area root named *input*, on
both Linux and Windows OSes.

## Cloning is encouraged :)

By all means, enhance it, play around and send a pull request.
