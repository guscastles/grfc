Season 2019, Round 2, Bonnet Bay.

9H-1, former 8H of 2018, is back in full formation again. Our boys are really excited for this new football season and ready to show again the great play from last year. After a few weeks of rain and game cancellations, we started our journey versing Bonnet Bay, a solid defence line that the Tigers pounded for the first minutes of the game. Being an apparent well structured squad, the visitors became comfortable with the game and opened the scoreboard at the 17-minute mark, not until Angus, our first half goalie, showing our great tradition in goals.
