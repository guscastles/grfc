Season 2019, Round 2, Bonnet Bay.

9H-1, former 8H of 2018, is back in full formation again. Our boys are really excited for this new football season and ready to show again the great play from last year. After a few weeks of rain and game cancellations, we started our journey versing Bonnet Bay, a solid defence line that the Tigers pounded for the first minutes of the game. Being an apparent well structured squad, the visitors became comfortable with the game and seized an opportunity to open the score at the 17-minute mark, not until Angus, our first half goalie, showing our great tradition in goals.

Second half was a different game. Our boys rose up to the challenge and dominated the pitch, with great skills in defence, dribbling, running with the ball, passing and shooting. They produced some great plays, showing guts and determination. It was a great display of football, with all present enjoying the spectacle. Unfortunately, sport has its idiosyncrasies and Bonnet Bay scored again at the end of the match. Noah was our goalie in the second half, with also great saves, and Elliot was our Man Of The Match, being a huge wall in the defence, demonstrating great tackling skills and a never-give-up attitude.

Tigers: Angus/Noah (goalies), Elliot, Henrik, Lachlan, Mitchell, Nicholas, Oliver, Xavier
