Season 2019, Round 1 (replay), Gymea United 1.

Sunny and warm day in April for our second match of the season. Or should I say, for our first opponent of the year? After the initial rainy days of the season, we faced again Gymea United, always a strong team with quick players. So much, that albeit the Tigers were dominating the first part of the first half, GUFC openend the score, seizing a rare opportunity for them in the at the 10-minute mark. From the beginning our boys showed a more rounded formation, with several opportunties lost against a compact defence from the Giants. Nevertheless, the team looked more resilient against the adversity and continued playing on.

After the oranges in the half-time, the Tigers came back with renewed strength and so did the Giants. The game became very intense with lots of opportunities for both sides. Xavier showed again the great tradition of the Tigers in goals and became the Great Wall of Tigers, with fantastic positioning, saving several goals. Lachlan, after some boucing of the ball in front of GUFC's goal, gave us the equaliser. Our boys demonstrated a solid strategy, with lots of passing, dribbling and running with the ball, even more against an opponent playing at home and determined to bring home the victory. At the 30-minute mark, Mitchell, after calibrating his foot with a few attempts, scored a beautiful goal from outside the box, reaching the upper right corner of the goal. At the last minute, Oliver sealed our victory, scoring again one of his typical goals. Nicholas was our Man Of The Match, demonstrating great skills in dribbling, passing and fighting for every ball.

Tigers: Elliot/Xavier (goalies), Angus, Henrik, Lachlan, Mitchell, Nicholas, Noah and Oliver.
